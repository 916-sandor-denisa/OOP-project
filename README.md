# OOP-project

This is the project that I have worked on throughout the second semester of the first year as a Computer Science student at UBB. 

This project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming principles and incorporates various design patterns commonly used in OOP. Additionally, it includes a graphical user interface (GUI) developed with the Qt framework.
